Magic in this world follows 10 laws :

1. The [[Mana]] is a pseudo-material, it's composed of magical particles. Every atom has a [[Mana]]-potential, representing how many magical particles it can hold.
2. Every kind of [[Mana]] has its own corresponding particle. Different kind of particles cannot mix in a single molecule.
3. Particles follow a phenomenon comparable to cellular mitosis but with no matter consumption. The magical particles renewing process depends on the environment consumption, however, it takes years for this natural process to adapt to changes.
4. Particles cannot give other kinds of particles.
5. [[Mana]] is naturally attracted to corresponding [[Entities]]
6. When two different kinds of [[Mana]] are forcefully coexisting in a single molecule, reactions are unstable and will seek for it's separated state violently.
7. The [[Demoniac Mana]] is highly unstable when in contact of any other kind of [[Mana]], that's why it exists only and alone in the [[Alter Realm]]. Any living being without a [[Demons]] [[Control Entity]] absorbing [[Demoniac Mana]] will suffer a painful death as its [[Entities]] are literally consumed by the [[Demoniac Mana]]. However, the [[Flesh Entity]] will actively protect the creature from undesired [[Demoniac Mana]] intake, making small expositions not threatening.
8. If someone where to be forcefully induced a [[Mana]] not fitting the one its [[Entities]] correspond to, their health would deteriorate quickly and its body will actively try to restore its equilibrium. Failure to do so will result in a swift death.
9. Some [[Mana]] kinds are compatible with each other, but individuals compatible with multiple [[Mana]] tend to be less powerful as a price of their versatility.
10. Every living being is associated with a magic and has some of it within, even though being able to wield it is a rare feat, particularly for not sentient beings. Life cannot exist without magic particles inside the creature.
