This entity allows a [[Kitsune]] self awareness about it's origin and the most important events of its History. It requires at least one ancestor of the individuals to have been aware of those important events. It's a requirement for awareness of their origin, but in this case the requirement is always met. It is linked to the [[Spirit Entity]].
On top of that, this entity allows easier learning for the young [[Kitsune]] and serves a spell library purpose for the individual, allowing them to learn many more spells.
