This entity is directly part of the [[Spirit Entity]]. It acts as a magic catalyst, allowing them for much more powerful spells without increasing [[Mana]] consumption. This entity is very desired by [[Human]] researches, but because of its placement, its extraction is a guaranteed and permanent death for the [[Kitsune]].
