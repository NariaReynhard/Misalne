This [[Entities|Entity]] is directly part of the [[Spirit Entity]]. It acts as a magic catalyst, allowing them for much more powerful spells without increasing [[Mana]] consumption. This [[Entities|Entity]] is very desired by [[Humans]] researches, but because of its placement, its extraction is a guaranteed and permanent death for the [[Kitsunes]].
