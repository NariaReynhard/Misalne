This [[Entities|Entity]] grants a particular magic signature to [[Kitsunes]] as well as allowing them to recognize the said signature. It allows [[Kitsunes]] to easily identify each other provided they are able to feel surrounding [[Mana]]. It is not simply linked to the [[Spirit Entity]] but is an extension of it. 
On top of that, it allows for a better [[Mana]] storage management.
