This entity is what visually makes a [[Kitsune]] different from a regular [[Human]]. It is responsible for it's ears, tail, sharp teeth etc. It is not simply linked to the [[Flesh Entity]] but is an extension of it.
On top of that, it improves the existing capabilities of the [[Flesh Entity]] when it comes to [[Mana]].
