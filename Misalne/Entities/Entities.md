Every intelligent living being is composed of a set of entities. Those entities can vary a lot but are depending on the specie. Two of them are common to every species. Those two are the "Primordial entities" : the [[Flesh Entity]] and the [[Spirit Entity]].

Next, we have the two additional entities specific to the [[Kitsune]] specie : the [[Kitsune Aspect Entity]] ; the [[Kitsune Essence Entity]] ; the [[Kitsune Memory Entity]] and the [[Kitsune Capacity Entity]].
