Every intelligent living being is composed of a set of [[Entities]]. Those [[Entities]] have a strong link with [[Mana]] and correspond to one kind of [[Mana]]. Every [[Entities]] composing an individual tend to link to the same kind of [[Mana]]. It is a vital component of an [[Entities|Entity]]. A complete exhaustion of [[Mana]] supplies implies death.

Those [[Entities]] can vary a lot but are depending on the specie. Two of them are common to every species. Those two are the "Primordial [[Entities]]" : the [[Flesh Entity]] and the [[Spirit Entity]].

Next, we have the four additional [[Entities]] specific to the [[Kitsunes]] specie : the [[Kitsune Aspect Entity]] ; the [[Kitsune Essence Entity]] ; the [[Kitsune Memory Entity]] and the [[Kitsune Capacity Entity]].

Then, we have two [[Entities]] for the [[Dragons]] : the [[Gregarious Entity]] and the [[Incendiary Entity]]. The [[Dragons]] are so ancient that their non-primordial [[Entities]] have simply fused with their [[Spirit Entity]], making it an undividable part of it.

We also have the [[Demons]] that add two more [[Entities]] : the [[Control Entity]] and [[Psychopomp Entity]]

Finally, we have the Artificial [[Entities]].
Those Primordial [[Entities]] are engineered by mages. It would be possible in theory to do other kind of [[Entities]] or even brand new ones, but it is such a complex endeavor that it never had been reached. Species made from these Artificial [[Entities]] such as [[Elves]] or [[Dwarves]] are considered artificial even if they fundamentally work just like any regular specie
