This entity represents the soul of a creature. It represents it's way of being, behaving, it's cleverness and everything that is not imputed to its physical abilities. It's the magical core of a being, where most of its [[Mana]] storage is located. It can only be affected by immaterial attacks. Once this entity is destroyed, the creature [[Flesh Entity]] remains lifeless. This kind of death is __permanent__.

When this entity is separated from the [[Flesh Entity]] and stored properly, the creature life can be restored by providing it with a compatible [[Flesh Entity]]. This can be done up to a few days after the separation, depending on the entity's strength and on the skills of the person who manipulate and stores it. After that the [[Spirit Entity]] will have faded away too much to be restored.
